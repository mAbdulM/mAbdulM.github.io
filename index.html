      <p> I have been programming for a while, in many different languages and game engines. As a result i have already made a large variety of projects ranging from games (<a href= https://shadow427.itch.io/space-game>like this one</a>) to prediction algorithms using machine learning.

    <h3>Java Game</h3>
    <p>
	This is the game I made in year one of City univeristy during the Java module.
	In this game, i made a variety of difficult and complex features, which you can see on the right.
	Unfortunately, i was unable to talk over it, so ill give a quick overview here:
	- use of a hierarchy of Layout managers
	you can see on the left there is a menu, that is neatly organised using different layout managers, likd grid and card layout.

	-different tracks play upon switch levels.
	
	-The enemy scouter: this enemy, (which you can see on the right) uses a finite state machine,
	The first state is Wandering, during which it will move around in random directions (avoiding hitting objects using a sensor placed directly in front of it). Once it detects a planet nearby, it will switch to the capturing state (the goal of this level)
	-capturing state, lets it turn that planet itno its colour, giving it perks tlike healing.
	-heal state, yo can see this in the start of this video, where once the enemy's hp drops below half, it speeds up and rushes to a planet it owns to heal.

	the most difficult part of this project was probably linking all these complex features together in a way that made the game enjoyable and makes sense.
